"""Base classes for single-frame measurement plugins and the driver task for these.

In single-frame measurement, we assume that detection and probably deblending have already been run on
the same frame, so a SourceCatalog has already been created with Footprints (which may be HeavyFootprints).
Measurements are generally recorded in the coordinate system of the image being measured (and all
slot-eligible fields must be), but non-slot fields may be recorded in other coordinate systems if necessary
to avoid information loss (this should, of course, be indicated in the field documentation).

class SingleFrameMeasurementTask(BaseMeasurementTask):
    """!
    A subtask for measuring the properties of sources on a single exposure.

    The task is configured with a list of "plugins": each plugin defines the values it
    measures (i.e. the columns in a table it will fill) and conducts that measurement
    on each detected source (see SingleFramePlugin).  The job of the
    measurement task is to initialize the set of plugins (which includes setting up the
    catalog schema) from their configuration, and then invoke each plugin on each
    source.

    When run after the deblender (see lsst.meas.deblender.SourceDeblendTask),
    SingleFrameMeasurementTask also replaces each source's neighbors with noise before
    measuring each source, utilizing the HeavyFootprints created by the deblender (see
    NoiseReplacer).

    SingleFrameMeasurementTask has only two methods: __init__() and run().  For configuration
    options, see SingleFrameMeasurementConfig.

    @section meas_base_sfm_Example	A complete example of using SingleFrameMeasurementTask

    The code below is in examples/runSingleFrameTask.py

    @dontinclude runSingleFrameTask.py

    See meas_algorithms_detection_Example for more information on SourceDetectionTask.

    First, import the required tasks (there are some other standard imports;
    read the file if you're confused):

    @skip SourceDetectionTask
    @until SingleFrameMeasurementTask

    We need to create our tasks before processing any data as the task constructors
    can add extra columns to the schema.  The most important argument we pass these to these
    is an lsst.afw.table.Schema object, which contains information about the fields (i.e. columns) of the
    measurement catalog we'll create, including names, types, and additional documentation.
    Tasks that operate on a catalog are typically passed a Schema upon construction, to which
    they add the fields they'll fill later when run.  We construct a mostly empty Schema that
    contains just the fields required for a SourceCatalog like this:

    @skipline schema

    Now we can configure and create the SourceDetectionTask:

    @until detectionTask

    (tableVersion is a temporary parameter that will be removed after the transition from the meas_algorithms
    Tasks to the meas_base Tasks is complete; for now, setting tableVersion=1 is necessary when using
    meas_base Tasks via pipe_tasks drivers).

    We then move on to configuring the measurement task:

    @until config

    While a reasonable set of plugins is configured by default, we'll customize the list.
    We also need to unset one of the slots at the same time, because we're
    not running the algorithm that it's set to by default, and that would cause problems later:

    @until psfFlux

    Now, finally, we can construct the measurement task:

    @skipline measureTask

    After constructing all the tasks, we can inspect the Schema we've created:

    @skipline print schema

    All of the fields in the
    schema can be accessed via the get() method on a record object.  See afwTable for more
    information.

    We're now ready to process the data (we could loop over multiple exposures/catalogs using the same
    task objects).  First create the output table and process the image to find sources:

    @skipline afwTable
    @skip result
    @until sources

    Then measure them:

    @skipline measure

    We then might plot the results (@em e.g. if you set `--ds9` on the command line)

    @skip display
    @until RED

    and end up with something like

    @image html runSingleFrameTask-ds9.png
