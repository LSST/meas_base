/**
 *  @brief C++ control object for peak likelihood flux.
 *
 * Peak likelihood flux requires an image that has been filtered by convolving with its own PSF
 * (or an approximate model). It is equivalent to a PSF flux (e.g. PsfFluxAlgorithm) computed on
 * a non-preconvolved image.
 *
 * The PSF must be provided in the exposure, as it is used to compute a weighting factor.
 *
 * Flux and error are computed as follows:
 * * flux = sum(unfiltered image * PSF) / sum(PSF^2)
 *        = value of peak of filtered source / sum(PSF^2)
 * * err  = sqrt(sum(unfiltered variance * PSF^2) / sum(PSF^2)^2)
 *        = sqrt(value of filtered variance at peak / sum(PSF^2)^2)
 * * The pixels in the image are samples of a band-limited function, and by using
 *   a sinc interpolation (via a warping kernel) we can evaluate this function at any point.
 *   We use this technique to compute the peak of the function, which is assumed to be
 *   at the centroid of the filtered source.
